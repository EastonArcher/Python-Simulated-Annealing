# 8 Queens Simulated Annealing
This Python code implements the Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve the classic Eight Queens Puzzle. The puzzle involves placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other; they cannot share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Problem Description 
The Eight Queens Puzzle requires finding a configuration of queen placements on the chessboard where no queen can capture another. This code provides a solution to this problem using the Simulated Annealing algorithm.
